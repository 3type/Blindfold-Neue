## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It blackens out everything beyond the xHeight or CapHeight. Useful for Spacing and Kerning because the xHeight or CapHeight is what matters most.

### Install

1. Install via the Plugin Manager in Glyphs.
2. Restart Glyphs.
